This is a unique software meant for a Vertical Farm, but can be implemented into any indoor plant system. It is capable of integrating with soil, moisture, and light sensors to most accurately assess the well-being of the garden based on input ranges for humidity, temperature, and light provided by the user based on their preferences. 


Main features:

     - A table of recommended ranges for humidity, temperature, and light for the top 20 most popular indoor plants
     
     - An analytics page to see trends and the necessary action to take based on sensor data 
     
     - An inventory of all the plants being tracked and stored inside the software's database
